### Help wanted

I don't have any ideas on what to add, or much motivation. My school district blocked bookmarklets, so I am not sure whether I should show my bypass or not. If you have any ideas, I will be happy to do it.

I haven't properly updated this in ages. I'm just going to keep this up in case anyone needs a bml that is here, but if you get an idea, or I get inspiration, then I could update it.

### currently working on:

ideas...

### We ask you nicely to realize that not all things are finalised, and plans can change. so please give no hate if things get removed from this list. Thank you.

# list of all bookmarklets

## a list of all the current bookmarklets and what they will do.

* all bookmarks.js


This is a hub for all of the bookmarklets in the repository. it is the thing executed when you run the main bookmarklet.
* 3d page


this will make the page you are currently on have a cool 3d effect.
* DOMII

A cool game you can play in your browser on top of the website. press space and a spaceship will destroy whatever is Infront of it. press W to move forward, A, and D to turn, and S does nothing :(
* archive search

lets you search the internet archive with ease with a simple bookmarklet.
* auto clicker

clicks automatically for lazy people or people that want a lot of cookies on cookie clicker.
* better ctrl f

this bookmark takes normal gorse ctrl f (a built-in search tool on chrome plus its derivatives and Firefox) and lets you search for more then one thing without losing the spot of the last thing.
* cached sites

google has this thing with stealing data if you don't know. and google makes copies of all websites and calls it cashed sites. they do this to improve load times. but unfortunately (for you school) this includes most of the website, thus unblocking it.
* classroom disguise

this may be replaced soon with a better one (planed). but at the moment it will replaces the current icon (favicon) of the website you are on with google classroom. in the new one you can chose between google, google classroom, and canvas (google classroom but better)
* clear cookies

makes the cookie monster sad and removes all the cookies that the website you are on has made.
* dark mode

dark reader if your school blocked all extensions. makes everything dark.
* edit site

this will let you modify the website you are on to what ever you want. this will only apply to you and will go away after reload. so no [insert friend name here] you did not just delete google.
* exec code

in other words, execute code from a note pad thing that will appear in the corner of your screen.
* inject script

this will inject a script. and it will show the box that reappears, with the original text still there. This is useful if you want to run code, modify code, run it another time without pressing ctrl c and v a infinite amount of times.
* inspect elament (broken)

it lets you inspect a element. useful if your school district has blocked inspect elements.
* notepad

small little notepad that can rest in the bottom right of your screen. good if you need to make notes quickly, and are on a Chromebook without a text editor.
* password generator

this will generate you a password with the questions it asks you. The password is completely random.
* piano

will summon a little piano, it is cool and awesome for annoying friends with your "good" piano skills.
* prevent tab from closing

this will give you a warning before you close a tab. so when you are mass closing your tabs for the day you don't lose any progress.
* snow in chrome

*tinyURL
this will make the url smaller, and make it more easy to shair.

make it snow with a cook effect on your tabs to impress your friends.
* unblocker1

works most of the time for unblocking lite websites. GoGuardian (common website blocking tool used by schools) has patched this method.
* unlocker1 tsunami

unblock stuff with repl. GoGuardian has blocked repl
* word type prank

make everything your friend types say something else of your choice. temporary and site based. 
* yt add skipper

lets you skip a ad when YouTube gives you 2 30 second ads.
* yt comments

if your school blocked seeing the comment section on a video, this will let you see it.
